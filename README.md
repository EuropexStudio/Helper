<h3 align="center">What is Helper ?</h3>

Helper can perform multiple tasks alone. It is a minecraft addon that offers high performance by reducing the number of plugins on the server and also provides free access to high-grade protections.

Aside from containing many protections, many of its features can be adjusted via the file.
Helper automatically saves worlds on request. Likewise, you can do this in-game.
When Helper can't find the Essentials plugin, it activates certain essentials lines so the server can go without essentials in the short term.
Helper, which has 3 different optimization types, can only work 100% efficiently on paper spigot.

**Optimization types:**
  - SkyBlock
  - Survival
  - Best

**Some skyblock plugins supported by Helper, which has an external rank-up plugin:**
